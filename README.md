Features
User-friendly interface for image labeling.
Fast processing to accommodate large datasets.
Compatible with YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5 formats.
Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
Labeling libraries e.g: labelImg, cv2
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/fabriceCODER/ishimwe_fabrice_labelling_image
cd yolo-image-labeling
Install required dependencies:
bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) If using labelImg, install it:
bash

Copy
pip install labelImg
labelImg
Usage
Place your images in the images/ directory.
Run the labeling tool:
bash

Copy
python label_tool.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to label your images.
Labeling Process
Open the labeling tool.
Select an image from the dataset.
Draw bounding boxes around the objects you wish to label.
Assign class labels to the bounding boxes.
Save the labels. The tool will generate a .txt file for each image in the YOLO format.
